    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nNumerous factors influence students’ educational experiences and outcomes in the varied public school system in the United States. Geographical disparities and educational equity are two interconnected variables that have a considerable impact on the American education system, and these are the subjects of this research. We seek to understand the complicated linkages between student accomplishment, geographic locations, and the equitable allocation of educational resources as we delve into the complex fabric of public schools across the country.\nIt has long been known that geographic differences in education have a significant influence on the standard of instruction, academic achievement, and general results. Diverse educational options are a result of regional variations in economic conditions, cultural landscapes, and community resources across the enormous length of the United States. This study aims to comprehend how geographic locations—rural, suburban, or urban—shape the educational environment and affect students’ academic performance.\nConcurrently, the idea of educational equity has become more well-known in the conversation about the justice and diversity of the educational system. The educational equality principle promotes giving all students, regardless of origin, colour, or socioeconomic level, the tools and assistance they require to achieve. This study will look into how much the country’s public schools adhere to the ideas of educational equity and how much of an impact these efforts have on reducing gaps in student performance.\nStudying the relationship between educational fairness and spatial inequities is a complex and multidimensional field. We want to identify trends that may contribute to or mitigate educational disparities by investigating the relationship between regional context and the distribution of educational opportunities and resources. Policymakers, educators, and communities must comprehend these factors in order to work towards building an inclusive and equitable education system that supports the success of all students.\nOur research aims to not only pinpoint the disparities that currently exist but also to offer insights that can guide evidence-based solutions and policy choices. We hope to add to the continuing conversation about enhancing American education by tackling the intricate relationship between equity and geography and making sure that all students, wherever they may reside, have access to a fair and excellent education."

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nIn our analysis, we are specifically examining missing values in the “total” column, which signifies the total number of students enrolled in each school. This column holds significant importance because the absence of total student numbers for a school renders the analysis of student figures across different races meaningless. Thus, our initial focus is on analyzing the percentage of missing values for total student counts in each state.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(openintro)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(choroplethr)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata = read.csv(\"Data/Public_School_Characteristics_2020-21.csv\")\n\nmissing_state &lt;- data %&gt;% \n    group_by(LSTATE) %&gt;% \n    summarise(sum_na = round(mean(is.na(TOTAL)),4)*100)\n\nmissing_state &lt;- missing_state %&gt;% \n                  transmute(region = tolower(usdata::abbr2state(LSTATE)), \n                            value = sum_na)\n\nstate_choropleth(missing_state %&gt;% drop_na(),\n                 title = \"Percentage of missing values for total students by State\",\n                 legend = \"Percentage\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. education system categorizes grades into corresponding school levels, such as Adult Education (AE), Prekindergarten (PK) for Prekindergarten, Prekindergarten (PK) to Grade 5 (G5) for Elementary, Grades 6 to 8 (G6-G8) for Middle School, and Grades 9 to 12 (G9-G12) for High School and Secondary. In our upcoming analysis, we’ve visualized missing values for each grade based on their associated school levels. To ensure a focused examination, it’s crucial to recognize the specific grades within each school level. Notably, a school level may not encompass all grades, as indicated in the graphical representation. For instance, when analyzing the “High School” category, missing values in columns “G09” through “G12” are of interest, recognizing that a high school is not expected to have students enrolled in, for instance, “G01.” and hence the missing values in “G01” can be ignored. This nuanced approach enables a more accurate assessment of missing value percentages for relevant grades within a particular school level in the dataset of public schools.\n\n\nCode\ndata1 = data %&gt;% drop_na(TOTAL)\n\ndata1 &lt;- data1 %&gt;% select(23,34:50)\n\nmissing_counts &lt;- data1 %&gt;%\n  group_by(SCHOOL_LEVEL) %&gt;%\n  summarize(across(-starts_with(\"SCHOOL\"), ~mean(is.na(.))*100, .names = \"{col}\"))\n\nmissing_counts_long &lt;- pivot_longer(missing_counts, cols = -starts_with(\"SCHOOL\"), names_to = \"Grades\", values_to = \"MissingCountPercent\")\n\ncustom_grades &lt;- c(\"PK\",\"KG\",\"G01\",\"G02\",\"G03\",\"G04\",\"G05\",\"G06\",\"G07\",\"G08\",\"G09\",\"G10\",\"G11\",\"G12\",\"G13\",\"UG\",\"AE\")\n\ncustom_SCHOOL_LEVEL &lt;- c(\"Prekindergarten\",\"Elementary\",\"Middle\",\"Secondary\",\"High\",\"Ungraded\",\"Adult Education\",\"Not Applicable\",\"Other\")\n\nmissing_counts_long$Grades &lt;- factor(missing_counts_long$Grades, levels = custom_grades)\nmissing_counts_long$SCHOOL_LEVEL &lt;- factor(missing_counts_long$SCHOOL_LEVEL, levels = custom_SCHOOL_LEVEL)\n\n# Create a heatmap\nggplot(missing_counts_long, aes(x = SCHOOL_LEVEL, y = Grades, fill = MissingCountPercent))+\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient() +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Values per Columns per Category\",\n       x = \"School Levels\",\n       y = \"Grades\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))"
