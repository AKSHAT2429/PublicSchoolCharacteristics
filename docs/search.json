    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nNumerous factors influence students’ educational experiences and outcomes in the varied public school system in the United States. Geographical disparities and educational equity are two interconnected variables that have a considerable impact on the American education system, and these are the subjects of this research. We seek to understand the complicated linkages between student accomplishment, geographic locations, and the equitable allocation of educational resources as we delve into the complex fabric of public schools across the country.\nIt has long been known that geographic differences in education have a significant influence on the standard of instruction, academic achievement, and general results. Diverse educational options are a result of regional variations in economic conditions, cultural landscapes, and community resources across the enormous length of the United States. This study aims to comprehend how geographic locations—rural, suburban, or urban—shape the educational environment and affect students’ academic performance.\nConcurrently, the idea of educational equity has become more well-known in the conversation about the justice and diversity of the educational system. The educational equality principle promotes giving all students, regardless of origin, colour, or socioeconomic level, the tools and assistance they require to achieve. This study will look into how much the country’s public schools adhere to the ideas of educational equity and how much of an impact these efforts have on reducing gaps in student performance.\nStudying the relationship between educational fairness and spatial inequities is a complex and multidimensional field. We want to identify trends that may contribute to or mitigate educational disparities by investigating the relationship between regional context and the distribution of educational opportunities and resources. Policymakers, educators, and communities must comprehend these factors in order to work towards building an inclusive and equitable education system that supports the success of all students.\nOur research aims to not only pinpoint the disparities that currently exist but also to offer insights that can guide evidence-based solutions and policy choices. We hope to add to the continuing conversation about enhancing American education by tackling the intricate relationship between equity and geography and making sure that all students, wherever they may reside, have access to a fair and excellent education."

    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\nIn our analysis, we are specifically examining missing values in the “total” column, which signifies the total number of students enrolled in each school. This column holds significant importance because the absence of total student numbers for a school renders the analysis of student figures across different races meaningless. Thus, our initial focus is on analyzing the percentage of missing values for total student counts in each state.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(openintro)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(tibble)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(choroplethr)\nlibrary(scales)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata = read.csv(\"Data/Public_School_Characteristics_2020-21.csv\")\n\nmissing_state &lt;- data %&gt;% \n    group_by(LSTATE) %&gt;% \n    summarise(sum_na = round(mean(is.na(TOTAL)),4)*100)\n\nmissing_state &lt;- missing_state %&gt;% \n                  transmute(region = tolower(usdata::abbr2state(LSTATE)), \n                            value = sum_na)\n\nstate_choropleth(missing_state %&gt;% drop_na(),\n                 title = \"Percentage of missing values for total students by State\",\n                 legend = \"Percentage\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. education system categorizes grades into corresponding school levels, such as Adult Education (AE), Prekindergarten (PK) for Prekindergarten, Prekindergarten (PK) to Grade 5 (G5) for Elementary, Grades 6 to 8 (G6-G8) for Middle School, and Grades 9 to 12 (G9-G12) for High School and Secondary. In our upcoming analysis, we’ve visualized missing values for each grade based on their associated school levels. To ensure a focused examination, it’s crucial to recognize the specific grades within each school level. Notably, a school level may not encompass all grades, as indicated in the graphical representation. For instance, when analyzing the “High School” category, missing values in columns “G09” through “G12” are of interest, recognizing that a high school is not expected to have students enrolled in, for instance, “G01.” and hence the missing values in “G01” can be ignored. This nuanced approach enables a more accurate assessment of missing value percentages for relevant grades within a particular school level in the dataset of public schools.\n\n\nCode\ndata1 = data %&gt;% drop_na(TOTAL)\n\ndata1 &lt;- data1 %&gt;% select(23,34:50)\n\nmissing_counts &lt;- data1 %&gt;%\n  group_by(SCHOOL_LEVEL) %&gt;%\n  summarize(across(-starts_with(\"SCHOOL\"), ~mean(is.na(.))*100, .names = \"{col}\"))\n\nmissing_counts_long &lt;- pivot_longer(missing_counts, cols = -starts_with(\"SCHOOL\"), names_to = \"Grades\", values_to = \"MissingCountPercent\")\n\ncustom_grades &lt;- c(\"PK\",\"KG\",\"G01\",\"G02\",\"G03\",\"G04\",\"G05\",\"G06\",\"G07\",\"G08\",\"G09\",\"G10\",\"G11\",\"G12\",\"G13\",\"UG\",\"AE\")\n\ncustom_SCHOOL_LEVEL &lt;- c(\"Prekindergarten\",\"Elementary\",\"Middle\",\"Secondary\",\"High\",\"Ungraded\",\"Adult Education\",\"Not Applicable\",\"Other\")\n\nmissing_counts_long$Grades &lt;- factor(missing_counts_long$Grades, levels = custom_grades)\nmissing_counts_long$SCHOOL_LEVEL &lt;- factor(missing_counts_long$SCHOOL_LEVEL, levels = custom_SCHOOL_LEVEL)\n\n# Create a heatmap\nggplot(missing_counts_long, aes(x = SCHOOL_LEVEL, y = Grades, fill = MissingCountPercent))+\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient() +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Missing Values per Columns per Category\",\n       x = \"School Levels\",\n       y = \"Grades\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90))"

The [20,30] bin has less than half the enrollment of the [10,20] bin, suggesting that higher ratios are associated with lower enrollment.\nLowest Ratios: The [0,10] bin has notably low total enrollment compared to [10,20], indicating less prevalence of very small class sizes.\nHigher Ratios: Enrollment continues to decrease with higher ratios, particularly beyond the [30,40] bin, indicating fewer students in settings where the ratio exceeds 30.\n\n\n\n3.0.3.3 Key Inferences:\n\nPreferred Ratios:\n\nThe data strongly suggests a preference for student-teacher ratios within the [10,20] range, as evidenced by the significantly higher enrollment in this bin compared to others. Educational institutions might consider this range when planning class sizes.\n\nResource Allocation and Constraints:\n\nThe noticeable decrease in enrollment with higher ratios ([20,30] and beyond) implies resource constraints or a deliberate choice in resource allocation. Education policymakers should consider the balance between maintaining lower ratios and optimizing resource utilization.\n\nQuality Implications:\n\nThe high enrollment in the [10,20] ratio range suggests a perceived or real quality advantage, given that lower ratios are often associated with better educational outcomes. Schools and policymakers may want to explore ways to maintain or achieve ratios within this range.\n\nPolicy and Funding Considerations:\n\nThe data hints at a potential alignment between educational policy and funding structures with a target student-teacher ratio, particularly in the [10,20] range. Policymakers may need to evaluate the effectiveness of these policies in achieving educational goals.\n\n\n\n\n3.0.3.4 Suggestions Based on Inferences:\n\nPolicy Review and Adjustment:\n\nEvaluate existing educational policies related to student-teacher ratios and consider adjustments based on the observed preferences and potential quality implications. This may involve revisiting funding models to support lower ratios.\n\nResource Optimization Strategies:\n\nDevelop strategies for optimizing resource allocation to maintain lower student-teacher ratios, especially within the [10,20] range. This could involve targeted funding for schools facing challenges in achieving desired ratios.\n\nQuality Assurance Measures:\n\nImplement measures to ensure and communicate the quality of education within the preferred student-teacher ratio range. This can include teacher training, curriculum enhancements, and community engagement initiatives.\n\nLong-Term Planning:\n\nConsider the long-term implications of student-teacher ratios on educational outcomes and plan accordingly. This may involve forecasting enrollment trends, projecting resource needs, and adapting policies to evolving educational landscapes.\n\nData Transparency:\n\nEnhance transparency by providing more context about the geographical scope and the timeframe of the data.

This regional variation may be influenced by population density, state policies, and urbanization.\n\nLower Enrollments in Western States:\n\nLighter shades in the western states indicate smaller average enrollments, possibly reflecting lower population density or a higher number of schools relative to students.\n\nVariation Among Neighboring States:\n\nNotable enrollment variations between neighboring states imply diverse educational landscapes influenced by state-level factors. Understanding these variations can inform targeted interventions.\n\nHighest Enrollment States:\n\nStates with the darkest shade, such as Texas and Florida, may require different educational resources and infrastructure planning due to their higher average enrollments.\n\nModerate Enrollments in the Midwest and East:\n\nModerate enrollments in many Midwest and East Coast states suggest a balance between school capacity and population distribution. This may inform resource allocation and infrastructure planning.\n\nCalifornia’s Enrollment:\n\nDespite being the most populous state, California does not have the darkest shade, indicating a nuanced distribution of students across numerous schools. Policy considerations might involve optimizing resources across a higher number of schools.\n\nNortheastern States:\n\nNortheastern states generally exhibit moderate to low average enrollments, possibly due to a higher number of smaller schools or slower population growth. Tailored policies may be needed for these states.\n\nPotential Data Anomalies:\n\nAlaska and Hawaii, not visible on the map, could offer unique insights into enrollment patterns influenced by their distinctive geographic and demographic factors. Including their data may provide a more comprehensive picture.\n\nImplications for Policy and Planning:\n\nStates with higher average enrollments may need targeted policies for infrastructure development and resource allocation. Understanding regional variations can assist policymakers in tailoring interventions based on specific needs.\n\n\n\n\n3.0.6.2 Suggestions Based on Inferences:\n\nInclusion of Alaska and Hawaii:\n\nInclude data for Alaska and Hawaii to provide a more comprehensive understanding of enrollment patterns, considering their unique circumstances.\n\nDetailed Regional Analysis:\n\nConduct a detailed regional analysis to identify specific factors influencing enrollment variations within regions. This can guide targeted policies for each state.\n\nCollaborative Planning Among Neighbors:\n\nEncourage collaborative planning and information-sharing among neighboring states with varying enrollments to foster cross-state learning and resource optimization.\n\nPopulation Projections:\n\nConsider incorporating population growth projections into educational planning to anticipate future enrollment trends and allocate resources effectively.\n\nInfrastructure Investment:\n\nStates with higher average enrollments may need strategic investments in educational infrastructure to accommodate larger student populations.\n\nPolicy Flexibility:\n\nDevelop policies that provide flexibility for states with different enrollment patterns, acknowledging the diverse educational landscapes across the country.\n\n\nThese suggestions aim to enhance the depth and applicability of the analysis, facilitating informed decision-making for educational policies and planning across the United States.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(usdata)\n\n# Calculate the average student-teacher ratio by state\navg_ratio_by_state &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(LSTATE) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg_ratio = mean(TOTAL, na.rm = TRUE))\n\navg_ratio_by_state &lt;- avg_ratio_by_state %&gt;%\n  transmute(region = tolower(usdata::abbr2state(LSTATE)),\n            value = avg_ratio)\n\n# Check for duplicate entries\nduplicates &lt;- avg_ratio_by_state %&gt;% filter(duplicated(region) | duplicated(region, fromLast = TRUE))\nif (nrow(duplicates) &gt; 0) {\n  message(\"Duplicate entries found.

Urban areas might have a higher concentration of Title I schools compared to rural areas.\n\nData Interpretation:\n\n\nInterpretation should consider that percentages represent the proportion of schools with Title I entitlement, not the proportion of students. The size of schools should be considered in understanding the data.\n\n\n\n3.0.7.2 Suggestions Based on Inferences:\n\nUrban-Rural Breakdown:\n\nProvide an additional breakdown of Title I entitlement based on urban and rural classifications to offer a more nuanced understanding of disparities.\n\nPoverty Rate Context:\n\nInclude context on poverty rates alongside the percentage of Title I schools to enhance the interpretation of socioeconomic patterns.\n\nState Policy Analysis:\n\nConduct a detailed analysis of state education policies to understand how they influence the distribution of Title I schools and propose targeted policy recommendations.\n\nInteractive Map Features:\n\nConsider incorporating interactive features that allow users to explore detailed information about each state, providing a more engaging and informative experience.\n\nCollaborative Research:\n\nEncourage collaborative research with state-level education departments to obtain additional insights and ensure accuracy in the representation of Title I entitlement.\n\n\nThese suggestions aim to enhance the depth of the analysis, ensuring a more comprehensive and context-rich interpretation of Title I entitlement patterns across the United States.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(usdata)\n\n# Calculate the percentage of \"Yes\" in the \"Title\" column by state\npercentage_yes_by_state &lt;- data1 %&gt;%\n  group_by(LSTATE) %&gt;%\n  summarise(percentage_yes = mean(TITLEI == \"Yes\", na.rm = TRUE) * 100)\n\npercentage_yes_by_state &lt;- percentage_yes_by_state %&gt;%\n  transmute(region = tolower(usdata::abbr2state(LSTATE)),\n            value = percentage_yes)\n\n# Check for duplicate entries\nduplicates &lt;- percentage_yes_by_state %&gt;% filter(duplicated(region) | duplicated(region, fromLast = TRUE))\nif (nrow(duplicates) &gt; 0) {\n  message(\"Duplicate entries found.
