# Introduction

Numerous factors influence students' educational experiences and outcomes in the varied public school system in the United States. Geographical disparities and educational equity are two interconnected variables that have a considerable impact on the American education system, and these are the subjects of this research. We seek to understand the complicated linkages between student accomplishment, geographic locations, and the equitable allocation of educational resources as we delve into the complex fabric of public schools across the country.

It has long been known that geographic differences in education have a significant influence on the standard of instruction, academic achievement, and general results. Diverse educational options are a result of regional variations in economic conditions, cultural landscapes, and community resources across the enormous length of the United States. This study aims to comprehend how geographic locations—rural, suburban, or urban—shape the educational environment and affect students' academic performance.

Concurrently, the idea of educational equity has become more well-known in the conversation about the justice and diversity of the educational system. The educational equality principle promotes giving all students, regardless of origin, colour, or socioeconomic level, the tools and assistance they require to achieve. This study will look into how much the country's public schools adhere to the ideas of educational equity and how much of an impact these efforts have on reducing gaps in student performance.

Studying the relationship between educational fairness and spatial inequities is a complex and multidimensional field. We want to identify trends that may contribute to or mitigate educational disparities by investigating the relationship between regional context and the distribution of educational opportunities and resources. Policymakers, educators, and communities must comprehend these factors in order to work towards building an inclusive and equitable education system that supports the success of all students.

Our research aims to not only pinpoint the disparities that currently exist but also to offer insights that can guide evidence-based solutions and policy choices. We hope to add to the continuing conversation about enhancing American education by tackling the intricate relationship between equity and geography and making sure that all students, wherever they may reside, have access to a fair and excellent education.
